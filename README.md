# CrackInspection_C++

The method is poroposed to solve the problems in current crack detection feild in terms of robustness, high precision, and practical application in a variety of practical scenarios. This method can not only eliminate the influence of unfavorable factors such as noise, light and background complexity, but also has low requirement for image image quality and has the ability of adapting to the image acquisition environment. Furthermore, it can also be easily extended to other similar scenarios, such as detection of capillaries in the medical field.

The main principle is that the neighbor points in curve have similar tangential direction.The proposed algorithm contains two main steps:track curve self according to tangential direction, and expand roughly according to normal direction. Please refer to http://blog.csdn.net/step_forward_ml for more detailed description of the proposed algorithm.
The implementation environment is VS 2013 and OpenCV 3.0+
